# Practical 1: ModelBuilder

The ModelBuilder practical introduced the concept of creating an ArcToolbox and making a new model within it. ModelBuilder is a fourth generation coding environment, and enables the creation of a basic ArcGIS program without having to handwrite any code using a simple drag-and-drop system. For this practical, an explosion model was created for the fictional Albert Square, which allows the user to investigate which buildings would be affected by an explosion at a given point. The model was then used to build a Python script.
